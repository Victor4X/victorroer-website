# discipline

## What is it?

There are two voices inside us:  
The one telling us "you should do this",  
and the one telling us "do it now"  

Discipline is the act of always heeding this second voice.  

## How do you train it?

Always, without fail, heed the second voice.  
Think like a soldier - don't think, just *do*.

But what about my health/bedtime/energy/x?  
They do not matter in this moment. If you heard the second voice, the voice of discipline. You must heed it.  
Only listening to the first voice will drive you mad with stress. I know this from experience.
